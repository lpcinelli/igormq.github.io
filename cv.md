## Short biography
---

Born in 1993, I obtained my B.Sc in Electronic and Computer Engineering at UFRJ along with my Engineer's Degree delivered by the french institution SUPÉLEC, where I spent 2 years as an international exchange program student and had a scholarship financed by the Brazilian government. During this time, I worked for 6 months as an intern at the french company PARROT Drones actively participating in the Computer Vision Team. I am currently doing my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with emphasis on Signal Processing program at COPPE/UFRJ, which I began in 2017, affiliated to the Signal, Multimedia and Telecommunications (SMT) laboratory in UFRJ, where I conduct my research. In this same laboratory, I developed B.Sc. final project on anomaly detection of surveillance videos using Deep Learning. My main interests include Deep Learning and Bayesian Approximate Inference with emphasis on videos/images.
