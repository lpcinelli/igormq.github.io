Hi, my name is **Lucas Cinelli** and I'm a Master's student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in [Electric Engineering Program](http://www.pee.ufrj.br) of [Instituto Alberto Luiz Coimbra de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa em Engenharia](http://coppe.ufrj.br) (COPPE).

My research interest is in the study and application of **deep learning** techniques, specially in *image segmentation*. Currently, I'm focusing on strategies to perform anomaly detection in surveillance videos.

I made this blog to share my knowledge that I've been acquiring through my masters, and doing that, I hope I can simplify the process of creating a speaker recognition for others researchers.

Enjoy! :)
